# Problem-Set-2
 This is Robin's Problem Set 2 submission.
For this problem set in the first exercise I completed the assignment by declaring an int, 2019. Then declaring a float, 0.23f, then declaring a char, "m". The next step was to just print my variables using printf("%char; %float; %int", c, f, i).

For the second exercise in the assignment, the task was write a program that would print a "pyramid", with each line having one "#" more than the last. How I did this was to declare an int Stacks = 8. This would control how many lines total there are. Then to declare an int i = 1. This would control what line is being printed. Then finally to declare an int x = 1. This controls how many "#" are on each line. From there I used a for statement to create a loop that would add one to i, and would complete when i was equal to stacks. Then  I used another for statement inside the first one that would print "#" x times, then add one to x, and this loop would complete when x was also equal to stacks.
